In a letter to FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, Inspector General Richard Skinner wrote that a federal court in 2008 ordered FEMA to change its process for recovering the money. But Monday, three years after that court ruling, \"These payments remain uncollected because your office has not given final approval of a new recoupment process,\" Skinner wrote. Following the back-to-back storms in 2005, FEMA disbursed more than $7 billion in assistance to survivors. At the time, the government placed a premium on distributing the money quickly because of the dire needs of residents of the Gulf Coast. The money was intended for rental assistance, home repairs, housing replacement, moving costs, medical costs and other individual assistance. But in the storm\\'s wake, FEMA estimated that approximately $643 million of the payments were improper due to human error and fraud. Early efforts to recover the money were themselves flawed, and in June of 2007, a federal judge ordered FEMA to discontinue its debt collection until changes were made to the process. FEMA immediately complied, Skinner wrote, and in 2008 the agency announced that it was stopping its recoupment of improper disaster payments until it could establish new procedures. FEMA also announced it would review each case of suspected fraud to confirm the validity of the debt. But, Skinner wrote, FEMA\\'s new recovery process has been awaiting approval by the administrator since late 2008. While FEMA has established a strategy, identified the necessary staff and initiated a review of the 160,000 cases, \"your office has not instructed the responsible parties to restart the recoupment process,\" Skinner wrote to Fugate. \"Further delay only makes aging debts more difficult to collect,\" Skinner wrote. In a statement to CNN, FEMA spokeswoman Rachel Racusen said FEMA is \"committed to being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.\" \"Not only do we agree with the Inspector General\\'s recommendation to recoup disaster assistance payments that were improperly disbursed... but we are and have been actively working with state and local leadership and other stakeholders to finalize plans to recoup misspent funds, while continuing to support Gulf Coast communities as they recover,\" she said. \"Under our current leadership, we have worked diligently to put protections in place that will safeguard against fraud and abuse, significantly reduce the percentage of improper payments, and develop a fair, open and transparent process for recovering these payments,\" Racusen said. Racusen said she did not have a date for when Fugate would authorize collection of debts, but said, \"We are well underway in taking the steps we need to begin this new process.\" In Skinner\\'s letter to Fugate, Skinner wrote Fugate should \"promptly take action\" to recover the money. Noting that President Barack Obama signed a presidential memorandum in March of 2010 asking departments to identify and reclaim misspent funds, Skinner said Fugate should \"promptly authorize the collection of this debt,\" he

often the world would be a much happier place   one commenter said  Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket

 she said  Ms Davis wasn t sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did  Ms Davis criticised  flat tittie chicks  and claimed they needed to focus on

new friend requests on Facebook  Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them  Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away   I  always got picked on and it wasn t until late in my 20 s that I became confident in myself   she said  While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street  her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door   She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size K bras in Australia   It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia   she said  Ms Davis said that she would do it all again  even considering the backlash the image has received   It s my life not theirs   she said   When

The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I \\xa0always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.\""]},"execution_count":33,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["val_subset['article'].iloc[0]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"4dI3Mnpoe0AQ"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyOnDIo/RFCV+/hPLa2MsQvX"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
