/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/data/data_collator.py:657: UserWarning: Creating a tensor from a list of numpy.ndarrays is extremely slow. Please consider converting the list to a single numpy.ndarray with numpy.array() before converting to a tensor. (Triggered internally at ../torch/csrc/utils/tensor_new.cpp:278.)
  batch["labels"] = torch.tensor(batch["labels"], dtype=torch.int64)
Passing a tuple of `past_key_values` is deprecated and will be removed in Transformers v4.48.0. You should pass an instance of `EncoderDecoderCache` instead, e.g. `past_key_values=EncoderDecoderCache.from_legacy_cache(past_key_values)`.
You set `add_prefix_space`. The tokenizer needs to be converted from the slow tokenizers
